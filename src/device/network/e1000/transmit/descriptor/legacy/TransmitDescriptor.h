 *
 * "Notes:
 *   Even though CSO and CSS are in units of bytes, the checksum calculation typically works on
 *   16-bit words. Hardware does not enforce even byte alignment.
 *
 *   Hardware does not add the 802.1Q EtherType or the VLAN field following the 802.1Q
 *   EtherType to the checksum. So for VLAN packets, software can compute the values to back
 *   out only on the encapsulated packet rather than on the added fields.
 *
 *   Although the Ethernet controller can be programmed to calculate and insert TCP checksum
 *   using the legacy descriptor format as described above, it is recommended that software use the
 *   newer TCP/IP Context Transmit Descriptor Format. This newer descriptor format allows the
 *   hardware to calculate both the IP and TCP checksums for outgoing packets. See Section 3.3.5
 *   for more information about how the new descriptor format can be used to accomplish this task."
