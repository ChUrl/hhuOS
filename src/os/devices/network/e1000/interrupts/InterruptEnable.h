/**
 * This interface provides methods for enabling individual interrupts.
 * To enable interrupts the register Interrupt Mask Set (IMS), which is mapped to MMIO-space, is used.
 *
 * "IMS (000D0h; R/W)
 *
 *  An interrupt is enabled if its corresponding mask bit is set to 1b, and disabled if its corresponding
 *  mask bit is set to 0b. A PCI interrupt is generated each time one of the bits in this register is set and
 *  the corresponding interrupt condition occurs. The occurrence of an interrupt condition is reflected
 *  by having a bit set in the Interrupt Cause Read Register (see Section 13.4.17).
 *
 *  A particular interrupt can be enabled by writing a 1b to the corresponding mask bit in this register.
 *  Any bits written with a 0b are unchanged. As a result, if software desires to disable a particular
 *  interrupt condition that had been previously enabled, it must write to the Interrupt Mask Clear
 *  Register (see Section 13.4.21) rather than writing a 0b to a bit in this register.
 *
 *  Reading this register returns bits that have an interrupt mask set.",
